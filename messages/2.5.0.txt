Add support for ListRIDsAscending

Update doc link to v11 wiki links.

Removed unnecessary doc link overrides for Index functions since the basic URL ends up in the right place due to an 
automatic redirect.

Added link overrides (and autocomplete) for QueryLongLockMulti and LongLockStillOwnedMulti, which are the only other 
functions in http://ptdoc.ptct.com/mwiki/index.php/Category:Functions that are currently used in the code and didn't 
already have an entry for doc link override and autocomplete.
