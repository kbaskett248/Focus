Better support for named variables:
  - Named variables are now supported when updating or generating documentation.
  - A new command has been added to update the Named Variables declaration in a
    subroutine. Find it in the command palette under Update Variable Declaration.
    This command only appears when the cursor is in a subroutine with Named Variables.
