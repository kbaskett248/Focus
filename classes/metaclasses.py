    A metaclass to be used for Sublime Mini Plugins.

    A Mini Plugin is a class that extends functionality for a framework.
    This metaclass provides the following features:
    1. The metaclass extends ABCMeta, so methods can be made abstract.
    2. The metaclass implements __lt__, so it can be sorted. Sorting is done
       by class name.
    3. Each class that is not abstract registers itself with the original base
       class. The classes are registered using the register method. If
       additional registering needs to be done, the method can be overridden,
       but you should always call the parent's register method.
    4. A list of the non_abstract child classes can be obtained using the
       get_plugins method.
